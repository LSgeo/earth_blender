# Getting Earth Blender Running
---
Earth blender builds on the standard blender install with a few additonal dependancies.

1. Installing Blender

Blender can be easily downloaded and installed from [here](https://www.blender.org/download/).
Once installed you'll need to launch blender. You'll be greeted with a screen like this.

From here you can select a different view port by clicking on the button below.

This will display the options you have for viewports in blender. These views can be usefull for a host of tasks in blender. However for now we'll just be using the python console.

Blender comes packaged with a version of python which can change depending on your os and when you installed blender. We'll need to know two key details to install the python dependencies. By selecting the python console view we can send commands to the bundled python package!
